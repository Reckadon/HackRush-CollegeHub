### Background
At IITGN, students rely on scattered communication channels—WhatsApp groups, emails, notice boards, and social media—for updates on events, club activities, and important announcements. This fragmented system often leads to missed deadlines, overlooked opportunities, and low engagement in extracurricular activities.   
Club coordinators struggle to promote events effectively, and administrators find it challenging to ensure that critical information, such as exam schedules and fee deadlines, reaches students in a timely manner. As a result, essential updates get lost in an overwhelming influx of messages, causing confusion and reduced participation in campus life.
To address these challenges, this project proposes the development of a Progressive Web Application (PWA) or another suitable technology-based solution. The goal is to create a centralized platform where students can stay informed, explore and register for events, join clubs, and receive real-time notifications—all in one place.
